# Migration handoff

Start with the current [Termrock migration and acceptance matrix](../architecture/termrock-migration-matrix.md). It records fixed source identities, application status, paired CLI coverage, architecture findings, unresolved differences, and next evidence. Treat every partial or missing result as incomplete work.

## Palette and shared-grid handoff (2026-10-21)

Preservation branch: `wip/palette-grid-repair-20261021`, tip `148c32c1bd7b646b032b3eaa739d1ee1338ecf2e` before this handoff update. The work is based on PR #38 commit `5c0075a09eec51b805f15d79ad945d4fb51fb5bf` and consists of:

- `7d5246b1b487dccfca76648bf13be13e2577026d`: remove exact-RGB global conversion exceptions; keep the frozen Junie ANSI-256 semantic values for `on_accent=232`, `border_strong=242`, and `disabled_fg=239`.
- `3a8b18362954da068e1c3418817fcb9d25c0ab37`: apply existing `Ui::scroll_edges` behavior in shared Grid and remove TablePro's private bottom-edge repaint.
- `148c32c1bd7b646b032b3eaa739d1ee1338ecf2e`: state the unresolved app-level repaint limitation accurately in the audit.

Focused checks: `cargo nextest run --locked -p termrock-grid` passed 125/125. The filtered theme check passed 2 tests, with 121 filtered. `cargo nextest run --locked -p tablepro-ui` passed 167/180 and failed 13; failures were not reproduced against the pre-change source, so their attribution remains unresolved. This is not application parity evidence.

Important limitation: TablePro's `draw_painted_grid` / `paint_scrolled_cells` runs after the shared Grid renderer and can overwrite the new shared fade. Thus direct Grid behavior is verified, but the application-visible final cells are not proven fixed. Remove that repaint only after mapping its row-number, cell-style, hit/focus and scrolling contracts to shared components, then compare the real CLI against the frozen baseline. An attempted merge into the existing WIP and theme-palette branches conflicts; integrate these commits through the PR #38 source branch after review and revalidation.

Next: independently review the exact commits, integrate onto current PR #38, repair the actual TablePro post-render repaint in its owning component migration, and only then continue the compatible per-color-level Split/Seam recipe work. Do not claim visual parity or treat the 13 failures as pre-existing.

## Fields integration blocked by incoming runtime change (2026-10-21)

Preservation branch: `wip/parent-fields-runtime-blocker-20261021`. The exact Fields source `332f40d07e38512f91cfb038eb9174c413755686` and its independent review are committed. Before synchronizing incoming PR #38 changes, scoped Fields/Forms/Runtime verification passed 504 tests with three existing skips, strict Clippy and scoped formatting. After normally merging shared PR #38 through `adf334b21745b9f713c26275987d09bf22eeda16`, the same suite has 503 passes and one allocation-test failure. Publication to PR #38 stopped.

The unchanged isolated allocation test fails with inherited `NO_COLOR` present (one allocation versus zero expected), and passes when that variable is absent. Incoming `modal_backdrop` now reads `std::env::var_os("NO_COLOR")` on each paint. Independent diagnosis and a shared-layer repair are required; removing the variable is diagnostic evidence, not a gate workaround. Preserve incoming history and all reference artifacts. See [exact blocker evidence](../audits/2026-10-21-fields-publication-incoming-runtime-blocker.json).

Next: independently review the incoming runtime change, fix the per-paint environment dependency without changing the test or hiding failures, rerun the complete scoped gate under the original environment, normally synchronize/push PR #38, and verify its remote SHA. All four applications remain incomplete.
## Showcase Selection bypass removal (2026-10-21)

Landed on `parity/termrock-visual-baseline`: the Selection page's ANSI
frame-replay bypass (`selectable/frames.rs` + two `.ansi` fixtures) is
replaced by the shared overlay `Dialog` and real selection rendering; the
shell no longer calls `selectable.stamp(ui)`. Evidence, the two
fixture-masked 120x40 captures that now fail on out-of-scope shell/nav/
footer drift, and the remaining lower-tier backdrop question are recorded
in `docs/audits/2026-10-21-selectable-bypass-removal.md`. Next steps:
have the shell owners reconcile nav/sidebar/footer painting with the
frozen captures (then re-approve on purpose), and hand the tier-dependent
modal-backdrop mapping to the runtime owners.

## Landing-queue integration state (2026-10-21)

Queue integration onto `parity/termrock-visual-baseline` is complete through step 7; pushed tip `bfbb72516` (sequence `8a8e28300` → `499cec504` → `efda9593a` → `2d66ea9be` → `bfbb72516`, all gated and pushed under the push lock). Full landing/skip/hold record: [migration matrix, PR #38 landing-queue section](../architecture/termrock-migration-matrix.md).

Resume points:

1. `parity/buttons-reference-decision-20261020` executable pins: re-advance the Buttons reference decision through the cohort-review machinery (six reviewed audit docs pin `frozen_cli_references.json` at `2a43fb11…`; branch pins `d5d8d648…`). Docs commits already landed.
2. `parity/tablepro-picker-live-20261020`: re-port 10 commits from the old `query_editor` model onto the landed `query_input` filter-list design, then run its frozen tab-picker geometry assertions; land only if green.
3. Still held per queue: `wip/textarea-fields-stage3-20261021`, `wip/steps-shared-contract-20261021`.

## TablePro shared Picker scope handoff (2026-10-21)

Preservation branch: `wip/tablepro-picker-scope-20261021`, implementation source `d911e577a1342729719a746a1b314bea7880be46` based on candidate `5f82c4d35d12e0fb77b0f580a8ef200240661602`. This branch contains the shared FilterList/Picker backward-scope and explicit selection-policy contract, TablePro opt-in wiring, regression tests, and audit `../audits/2026-10-21-tablepro-picker-scope.md`. A follow-up optimization in `crates/termrock-navigation/src/filter_list.rs` avoids query cloning/storage for default `Preserve` consumers; its focused tests and strict shared Clippy pass. The exact final preservation tip is the commit that adds this entry.

Verification is scoped, not full parity. The package nextest run had 545/557 passing and 12 failing; the same-source pre-change run had the identical 12 failures, listed in the audit. Focused navigation, Picker projection and real TablePro tests pass, as do strict shared Clippy, formatting, and `git diff --check`. Two deliberate negative probes failed as intended: removing BackTab scope binding and removing the Picker's query-reset rearm. Logs are preserved under `/private/tmp/termrock-tablepro-picker-scope-logs/`; package-before, package-final, package-verified, negative-probe, and focused/Clippy SHA-256 values are recorded in the audit or the agent handoff. No pinned real-CLI paired comparison was run; application parity is incomplete.

Publication blocker: the repository push lock was owned by `termrock-fix-findings` (`.git/push.lock`, owner timestamp `2026-10-21T07:34:14Z`) when checked. This worktree did not acquire or alter it. Parent coordination owns publication and independent review. Next: review this exact source against current PR #38; assess incoming TablePro `app.rs`, `tab_ownership`, and native-baseline changes separately; resolve the lock; then normally synchronize, rerun the required gate on exact HEAD, publish this WIP and verify the remote SHA. Do not blindly rebase or treat fixtures as accepted output. The pinned paired app comparison and the remaining TablePro tab-strip repaint/geometry work are still required.

### Independent-review fixes for the TablePro Picker handoff (2026-10-21)

The reviewer found two defects in `d911e577a1342729719a746a1b314bea7880be46`: actual `BackTab + SHIFT` did not match the shared BackTab binding, and explicit `reset_selection_on_next_reconcile` was ignored under `SelectionPolicy::Preserve`. Both failures were reproduced on the pre-fix WIP tests. Shared fixes and regression tests are committed as `1e30bd458dafc3f493cba207acb135ac964f85ce`; details are in the Picker audit above.

After the fix, the four focused tests passed. `cargo nextest run -p termrock-core -p termrock-runtime -p termrock-controls -p termrock-navigation -p termrock-overlays --no-fail-fast` passed 923/923 with 3 skipped. Strict all-target Clippy for those packages, full workspace formatting, and `git diff --check` passed. This is focused shared-contract evidence, not real-CLI parity. The final WIP tip after this handoff update is recorded by the following docs commit.

Publication still requires independent review of the fixes and synchronization with the current PR #38 head. Do not remove the push lock owned by another workstream, force-push, or merge current TablePro `app.rs`/`tab_ownership`/native-baseline changes without separate assessment. Parent coordination owns publication if the lock remains held.

### PK3 global KeyMap mutation consistency (2026-10-21)

The follow-up independent review of `1e30bd458dafc3f493cba207acb135ac964f85ce` found raw `Chord` comparisons in global `KeyMap::remove`, `KeyMap::remap`, and before-typing removal. The behavior and RED/GREEN proof are in the audit section above. Shared mutation and regression changes are committed as `0d821bda6345e29d4f481745d2cf815f8274c54`.

The pre-fix `global_keymap_mutations_use_effective_chord_identity` test failed because removal by BackTab+SHIFT left its logical binding active. The post-fix focused contract set passed 5/5. All affected packages passed 924/924 tests with 3 skipped: `termrock-core`, `termrock-runtime`, `termrock-controls`, `termrock-navigation`, and `termrock-overlays`. Strict all-target Clippy for these packages, `cargo fmt --all --check`, and `git diff --check` passed. The exact WIP tip after this handoff update is recorded by the following documentation commit.

This remains shared-contract verification only. There is no pinned real-CLI baseline comparison in this workstream. The PR #38 push lock must be respected; parent coordination owns integration and publication if it is held.
