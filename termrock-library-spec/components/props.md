# W34 · Props

**Group:** Data and text · **Phase:** P3 · **Classification:** baseline-component  
**Visual commit:** `4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`  
**Status:** proposed API; implementation, compilation, captures and independent review not executed.

## Purpose and boundary

Borrow rich label/value rows, tones and safe display text. No introspection of a domain struct or automatic secret formatting.

Legacy family mapping: `C43`  
Proposed implementation home: `crates/termrock/src/components/props.rs`. Thin wrappers may share this file; this is not permission for duplicate engines.

## Proposed public API

Signature-declaration notation; consuming builders omit `self -> Self`. See [shared public API](../PUBLIC-API.md), [type dictionary](../reference/TYPES.md), and [visual proof contract](../VISUAL-VERIFICATION.md).

```rust
Props::new(id: Id, rows: &'a [PropsRow<'a>]) -> Props<'a>

draw(&self, ui: &mut Ui<'_>, area: Rect) -> Rect
measure(&self, cx: &MeasureCx<'_>, constraints: Constraints) -> Size
```

Configuration builders:

```rust
label_width(LabelWidth)
patch(StylePatch)
patch_part(Part, StylePatch)
```

**Durable state:** None for static Props; interactive navigation belongs to PropsList.



**Typed actions:** None.

## Visual parts and composition

Advertised styled parts: `container`, `label`, `value`, `separator`, `status`.

Standard style overrides follow the shared theme precedence. Only explicitly supported parts accept replacement slots; geometry, focus/capture and whole-surface ownership are not replaceable. Decorative fragments may use their parent's attribution scope. Preserve baseline text, glyphs, spacing, surface and clipping; do not infer a new design from the component name.

Implementation dependencies: Shared foundations only.

## Behavioral contract

1. Two-column layout preserves baseline label alignment, continuation wrapping and value emphasis.
2. Distinguish ordinary text, styled text, empty value and protected/redacted value through typed PropsValue.
3. Static properties do not introduce row focus or copy behavior; use PropsList for that.
4. A secret reference exposes only an explicitly safe display value, not a generic Debug/String conversion.

## Applicable states

| Axis | Required states / disposition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| geometry | `normal`, `zero_area`, `tiny_area`, `nonzero_origin`, `exact_fit`, `one_cell_short`, `unicode_long_content`, `narrow_then_wide` | component |
| focus_hover | **Not applicable:** Display-only surface; Field/Panel may reflect child focus but do not create independent interactive state. | no independent focus stop |
| activation | **Not applicable:** No generic whole-surface activation. Text/scroll/selection gestures and child actions are covered by their own cases. | none at this surface |

Each advertised visual variant gets every individually applicable state. Mandatory combinations and fixture dimensions follow the shared proof contract. The component-specific cases below refine these axes; they do not replace them.

## Required acceptance cases

| Case ID | Required observation |
|---|---|
| W34-01 | long label and wrapped value at narrow width |
| W34-02 | mixed styled/plain/masked/empty values |
| W34-03 | nonzero origin and clipped continuation line |
| W34-04 | static Props produces no focus or pointer activation |

For every case record exact cells/cursor, the stable focus/capture/layer owners, action count and target, and relevant draft/selection/source state. Cases introducing new safety/API behavior need an Extension disposition when no baseline counterpart exists. Invalid or unavailable oracle setup is a blocked capture, never a passing test.

## Reference/capture deliverable

Use [capture-plans/props.json](../capture-plans/props.json). It specifies required source roots, dimensions, capabilities and cases. It deliberately has no approved expected artifacts. Capture from the pinned source using trusted adapters, seal numeric gestures/time samples, then compare candidate public code.

Accept this component only after its external-consumer API example compiles, source-state tests and exact applicable snapshots pass, no semantic state changes during draw, documented parts affect actual cells, and an independent reviewer checks the API and evidence. A painted placeholder or a call later overwritten by custom paint is a failure.
