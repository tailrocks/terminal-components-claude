# W04 · Toggle

**Group:** Controls · **Phase:** P3 · **Classification:** baseline-component  
**Visual commit:** `4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`  
**Status:** proposed API; implementation, compilation, captures and independent review not executed.

## Purpose and boundary

Caller owns value and wording; Toggle shares the Checkbox choice reducer but has its own baseline visual recipe.

Legacy family mapping: `C13`  
Proposed implementation home: `crates/termrock/src/components/choice.rs`. Thin wrappers may share this file; this is not permission for duplicate engines.

## Proposed public API

Signature-declaration notation; consuming builders omit `self -> Self`. See [shared public API](../PUBLIC-API.md), [type dictionary](../reference/TYPES.md), and [visual proof contract](../VISUAL-VERIFICATION.md).

```rust
Toggle::new(id: Id, label: &'a str, on: bool) -> Toggle<'a>

update(&self, cx: &mut Cx<'_>) -> Response<ValueChanged<bool>>
draw(&self, ui: &mut Ui<'_>, area: Rect) -> Rect
measure(&self, cx: &MeasureCx<'_>, constraints: Constraints) -> Size
```

Configuration builders:

```rust
disabled(bool)
patch(StylePatch)
patch_part(Part, StylePatch)
```

**Durable state:** None; controlled on/off value.



**Typed actions:** ValueChanged<bool> { value: bool, origin: ActivationOrigin }

## Visual parts and composition

Advertised styled parts: `container`, `gutter`, `marker`, `label`.

Standard style overrides follow the shared theme precedence. Only explicitly supported parts accept replacement slots; geometry, focus/capture and whole-surface ownership are not replaceable. Decorative fragments may use their parent's attribution scope. Preserve baseline text, glyphs, spacing, surface and clipping; do not infer a new design from the component name.

Implementation dependencies: Shared foundations only.

## Behavioral contract

1. Preserve the baseline toggle glyph/spacing rather than drawing a graphical switch from another design system.
2. On/off is not the same as keyboard focus. Use exactly the same one-action-per-gesture and disabled containment rules as Checkbox.
3. No separate event router, animation loop or persistence behavior.

## Applicable states

| Axis | Required states / disposition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| geometry | `normal`, `zero_area`, `tiny_area`, `nonzero_origin`, `exact_fit`, `one_cell_short`, `unicode_long_content`, `narrow_then_wide` | component |
| focus_hover | `unfocused`, `focused`, `hovered`, `focus_and_hover`, `keyboard_suppresses_hover`, `pointer_motion_restores_hover` | interactive owner or child; Brand only in interactive mode; Steps only in navigable mode; no decorative focus stop |
| activation | `pointer_down`, `held_press`, `release_inside`, `release_outside`, `removed_target`, `disabled_target`, `keyboard_activate`, `activation_feedback`, `feedback_expired` | eligible actionable part; composite uses real child action controls |

Each advertised visual variant gets every individually applicable state. Mandatory combinations and fixture dimensions follow the shared proof contract. The component-specific cases below refine these axes; they do not replace them.

## Required acceptance cases

| Case ID | Required observation |
|---|---|
| W04-01 | on/off crossed with normal, focused, hovered and disabled |
| W04-02 | Enter/Space and mouse produce the same next controlled value |
| W04-03 | adjacent toggles do not overlap hit regions |
| W04-04 | minimum width and clipped marker/label behavior |

For every case record exact cells/cursor, the stable focus/capture/layer owners, action count and target, and relevant draft/selection/source state. Cases introducing new safety/API behavior need an Extension disposition when no baseline counterpart exists. Invalid or unavailable oracle setup is a blocked capture, never a passing test.

## Reference/capture deliverable

Use [capture-plans/toggle.json](../capture-plans/toggle.json). It specifies required source roots, dimensions, capabilities and cases. It deliberately has no approved expected artifacts. Capture from the pinned source using trusted adapters, seal numeric gestures/time samples, then compare candidate public code.

Accept this component only after its external-consumer API example compiles, source-state tests and exact applicable snapshots pass, no semantic state changes during draw, documented parts affect actual cells, and an independent reviewer checks the API and evidence. A painted placeholder or a call later overwritten by custom paint is a failure.
