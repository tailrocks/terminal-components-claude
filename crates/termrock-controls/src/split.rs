//! `SplitPane` — the two-pane split and its draggable seam
//! (`COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §10, §14.1, §18.2 `splitter`, §18.3 item 20,
//! Appendix A 4E).
//!
//! The legacy `Splitter` widget and the `ui::layout::Split` value type are
//! **one** component here: the seam cannot register a hit region without the
//! container rect, and the container rect cannot be known without laying the
//! split out, so keeping them apart forced every caller to cache a
//! `seam_container: Rect` between the two phases. `SplitPane::draw` owns that
//! rect and reports it, and `update` reads it back through `Cx::area`.

/// Two panes with a draggable seam between them.
///
/// ## Construction
/// `SplitPane::new(id, axis)` — the axis is required because it is not a
/// look but a different layout, and a `bool` for it would be exactly the
/// parameter soup §13 forbids.
///
/// ## Ownership
/// The caller owns a [`SplitPaneState`] (percent and maximise state) and
/// paints both panes in `draw`'s body closure. The runtime owns focus,
/// hover, press and the seam's pointer capture.
///
/// ## Configuration
/// `.gap(u16)` (`1`), `.min_first(u16)` (`1`), `.min_second(u16)` (`1`),
/// `.resizable(bool)` (`false`), `.disabled(bool)` (`false`),
/// `.seam_start/center/end(width)` (full gap
/// by default), `.patch`, `.patch_part`, `.slot`,
/// reference fixtures use [`Ui::reference`](crate::Ui::reference).
///
/// ## Variants
/// `Family::SPLIT`, `Variant::DEFAULT` only.
///
/// ## States
/// The seam wears `HOVERED`, `FOCUSED` and `PRESSED` from the runtime; a
/// live seam capture keeps `PRESSED` for the whole drag. `DISABLED` comes
/// from the explicit disabled prop and revokes focus/input admission.
///
/// ## Actions
/// `SplitAction::Resized(u8)` — the seam moved, carrying the new percent.
/// It carries no `ItemKey`: a split has no items. Maximising is not an
/// action because it is not an input the component owns: the caller calls
/// [`SplitPaneState::toggle_max`] and already knows.
///
/// ## Focus
/// One `Focusable` stop over the whole container by default, or the visible
/// seam when its width/alignment is configured, registered **only** when
/// `.resizable(true)`, because a seam nobody can move with the keyboard has
/// no business in the ring. Disabled instances register an unreachable stop
/// for shared admission and capture cancellation. It does not swallow typing,
/// opens no scope and traps nothing.
///
/// ## Keyboard
/// Only when `.resizable(true)` and enabled; the table is empty otherwise.
/// The hint bar advertises nothing that does not work. Horizontal: `←` narrower, `→`
/// wider, `Home` balance. Vertical: `↑` shorter, `↓` taller, `Home`
/// balance.
///
/// ## Mouse
/// `PartRef::of(Part::SEAM)`: a press claims pointer capture, drags put the
/// seam under the pointer (clamped by the minima), release ends the
/// capture, and a double-click balances the panes. Disabled instances reject
/// all of these actions. Nothing else in the container is a hit target of
/// this component's.
///
/// ## Layout
/// [`SplitModel`] does the arithmetic: `gap` cells between the panes, the
/// minima honoured, and **when both minima cannot fit the first pane wins
/// on both axes** — which is also the narrow-collapse mode, so a caller
/// that wants a single pane below a width sets `min_second` and lets the
/// model collapse. `measure` reports the minima plus the gap. `draw`
/// passes the two pane rects to its body; both are `Rect::ZERO`-safe and either may be
/// empty (maximised or collapsed). A degenerate `area` registers nothing
/// and passes two origin-anchored empty rects to the body (R5).
///
/// ## Parts
/// `SEAM` — the configured strip within the gap (the full gap by default),
/// and the only part this component paints. The
/// panes are the caller's.
///
/// ## Overrides
/// `.patch` and `.patch_part` reach `Part::SEAM`. `.slot` is honoured for
/// `Part::SEAM`, which is the whole of this component's painting.
///
/// ## Identity
/// One `Id`; no items and no `ItemKey`.
///
/// ## Testing
/// `SplitPaneCase` with `Caps::FOCUSABLE | Caps::CAPTURES` and a fixture
/// that sets `.resizable(true)`; `render::components::split_pane::*`.
///
/// ## Invariants
/// The seam is painted with the **quiet** rule glyph at rest, the **active**
/// rule glyph while pressed, and `GlyphRole::FocusBar` while focused, so all
/// three states differ by a symbol and survive `ColorLevel::Mono` — the
/// recipe's own `SEAM` rules are colour-only, and R-8 forbids a component
/// assembling a `Style` of its own. The container rect `update` reads back
/// through published logical layout facts is the one `draw` used, even when
/// ancestor clipping narrows the visible and hittable seam.
