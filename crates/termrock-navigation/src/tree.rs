//! `Tree` (`COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §12.4, §18.2, §20.9-8, Appendix A 4C).
//!
//! The legacy `TreeView` owned a `Vec<FlatRow>` of cloned labels and rebuilt
//! it on every expand, collapse, filter change and lazy delivery — ≈300 000
//! allocations per toggle on a 100 k-node tree (§16.6
//! `tree_100k_nodes_flatten`). The runtime now owns a keyed `TreeIndex` of
//! source positions and structural metadata. It holds no borrowed item or
//! text, is built once per explicit source/query revision, and is shared by
//! update and draw. A branch toggle splices only its contiguous subtree;
//! unchanged phases read the visible window directly.

/// A keyed, scrollable hierarchy over a borrowed pre-order slice.
///
/// ## Construction
/// `Tree::new(id)`; the nodes are passed to each phase, never held. Without
/// a `.node(…)` accessor every item is a depth-0 leaf, so an unconfigured
/// tree is a flat list.
///
/// ## Ownership
/// The caller owns the nodes (`&[T]` per phase, **pre-order**: a node's
/// descendants follow it contiguously at a greater depth) and a
/// [`TreeState`]. The runtime owns focus, hover, press, wheel routing and
/// the scrollbar capture.
///
/// ## Configuration
/// `.node(&dyn Fn(&T) -> TreeNode)` (default: every item is
/// `TreeNode::leaf(0)`), `.key(Fn(&T) -> ItemKey)` (`ByIndex`, unstable
/// under reorder — [`TreeNode::keyed`] wins over it), `.row(Fn(&T, &mut
/// RowUi))` (`DefaultRow`: `Display`), `.disabled_item(&dyn Fn(&T) -> bool)`,
/// `.query(revision, &dyn Fn(&T) -> bool)` (strict matches plus ancestors),
/// `.disabled(bool)` (default `false`), `.empty(EmptyState)` (a default
/// "Nothing here yet"), `.patch`, `.patch_part`, `.slot`.
///
/// ## Variants
/// `Family::TREE`, `DEFAULT` only.
///
/// ## States
/// The tree wears `FOCUSED`, `FOCUS_VISIBLE`, `HOVERED` and `PRESSED` from
/// the runtime and `DISABLED` from `.disabled`. A row derives `FOCUSED` /
/// `FOCUS_VISIBLE` / `PRESSED` when it is the cursor, `SELECTED` when it is
/// the chosen leaf, `EXPANDED` when it is an open branch, and `DISABLED`
/// from `.disabled_item` or from the whole tree being disabled. The tree
/// takes **no** `.status(Status)` prop: readiness in a tree is per node
/// (`NodeKind::Lazy`), not per component, and §11.4 forbids accepting a
/// readiness prop without painting its affordance.
///
/// ## Actions
/// `Moved`, `Expanded(k)`, `Collapsed(k)`, `Chose(k)`, `Activated(k)`.
/// `Expanded(k)` on a [`NodeKind::Lazy`] node is the fetch request the
/// legacy `TreeEvent::Expand(path)` was, now carrying a key instead of a
/// `Vec<usize>`.
///
/// ## Focus
/// One `Focusable` stop for the whole tree (`Disabled` when `.disabled`);
/// does not swallow typing.
///
/// ## Keyboard
/// `↑`/`k`, `↓`/`j`, `PgUp`, `PgDn`, `Home`/`g`, `End`/`G`; `→`/`l` opens a
/// closed branch or descends into an open one; `←`/`h` closes an open branch
/// or moves to its parent; `Enter` toggles a branch and activates a leaf;
/// `Space` chooses a leaf or toggles a branch. Opt-in `branch_activation`
/// lets Enter activate branches without changing Space. When at least one node in the slice can open,
/// `*` and `-` open and close everything.
///
/// ## Mouse
/// `PartRef::item(Part::ROW, k)`: press moves the cursor, click toggles a
/// branch or chooses a leaf, double-click activates a leaf. `branch_click`
/// can choose branches instead; `branch_activation` also applies to double-click.
/// `PartRef::item(Part::ICON, k)` is the disclosure cell: press moves the
/// cursor and click toggles that node without choosing it. `TRACK`/`THUMB` and the wheel go
/// to the embedded [`ScrollRegion`].
///
/// ## Layout
/// One row per visible node: gutter, `depth × design.space.tree_indent`
/// columns of indent, the one-cell disclosure, then the renderer's row; a
/// scrollbar column when the visible rows overflow. `measure` is
/// `(8…, offered height)`; `draw` returns `area`. `0×0` registers nothing
/// (R5).
///
/// ## Parts
/// `CONTAINER` (the tree surface and each row's fill), `GUTTER` (the focus
/// column), `ICON` (the disclosure cell and its hit zone), `MARKER` (the
/// reserved cell after disclosure), `LABEL` (resolved through [`RowUi`] by
/// the row renderer), `TRACK` / `THUMB` (the embedded [`ScrollRegion`]),
/// `EMPTY` (the no-nodes state). `Part::ROW` is a hit region only and is
/// deliberately not styled.
///
/// ## Overrides
/// `.patch` and `.patch_part` reach `Part::CONTAINER`, `Part::GUTTER`,
/// `Part::ICON`, `Part::MARKER`, `Part::LABEL` and `Part::EMPTY`, and are
/// forwarded to the embedded [`ScrollRegion`] so they also reach
/// `Part::TRACK` and `Part::THUMB`. Owner `CONTAINER` and `LABEL` patches are
/// forwarded only to [`RowUi`]'s automatic row fill and label painters;
/// caller-painted row parts keep their own styles.
/// `.slot(p, …)` changes painted cells for exactly `Part::GUTTER`,
/// `Part::ICON`, `Part::MARKER`, `Part::EMPTY`, `Part::TRACK` and
/// `Part::THUMB`.
/// `Part::CONTAINER` and `Part::LABEL` are **not** slot-addressable: the
/// container fill is overpainted by every row, and the label belongs to the
/// row renderer, which is the caller's own painter already.
///
/// ## Identity
/// [`TreeNode::keyed`] first, then `.key`, then `ByIndex` — which is
/// unstable under insert, remove and reorder. Expansion, the cursor and the
/// chosen leaf are all stored as `ItemKey`, so a node keeps its state across
/// an expand, a collapse and a reorder
/// (`tree::expand_collapse_is_keyed_not_positional`).
///
/// ## Testing
/// `TreeCase` with `ACTIVATES | DISABLEABLE | FOCUSABLE | COLLECTION |
/// SCROLLS`; `render::components::tree::*`. `CAPTURES` belongs to the
/// embedded [`ScrollRegion`], whose thumb claims the capture, and is
/// declared by `ScrollRegionCase`.
///
/// ## Invariants
/// `reconcile` runs before any action is emitted. The runtime cache owns only
/// source indexes, keys, depth and kind — never `T` or borrowed text. Initial
/// source/query changes rebuild once; ordinary expand/collapse splices the
/// affected contiguous subtree; unchanged update and draw are bounded by the
/// viewport. Only visible rows invoke the borrowed row renderer.
