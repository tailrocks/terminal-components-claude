//! `Grid` — the one tabular component (`COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §12.3,
//! §17.0 A3/A7, §23 K2 (Adjudication K), Appendix A 4I).
//!
//! Capability is chosen by the **entry point**, never by a flag ([`Grid::update`]
//! for a read-only grid, [`Grid::update_editable`] for an editing one), so a
//! read-only grid is structurally incapable of mutating its model (§23 K2, G1
//! and G4). `GridCellActions` does not exist: its `actions` is a defaulted
//! [`GridModel`] method, because `draw` paints the affordance and must see it
//! (§23 K2, G3).
//!
//! ## Sorting is a request, never a permutation
//!
//! The grid paints sortable headers and emits [`GridAction::Sort`]. The model
//! adapter owns display order and every domain comparison (including numeric
//! and NULL ordering); this module contains no order vector, comparator or
//! rendered-text fallback (§52). Rows are addressed by [`ItemKey`] and columns
//! by [`ColumnKey`], so an adapter reorder leaves cursor, range, selection and
//! pending edit bound to the same logical cells.

/// `Grid::update_editable` takes `&mut M: GridEditor`, `Grid::draw` takes
/// `&M: GridModel` — the same bound and the same shared borrow as `update`.
///
/// ## Ownership
/// The caller owns the columns, the model and a [`GridState`]; the runtime
/// owns focus, hover, press, wheel routing and the scrollbar capture. The
/// inline editor is a child component addressed by `id.part(Part::TEXT)`.
///
/// ## Configuration
/// `.nav(NavUnit)` (`Cell`), `.select_mode(SelectMode)` (`Single`),
/// `.gutter(GridGutter)` (`Compact`), `.right_reserve(u16)` (`0`),
/// `.part_defaults(&[(Part, StylePatch)])` (detailed-gutter role defaults),
/// `.empty(EmptyState)` (a default "Nothing here yet"), `.actions_slot(&dyn
/// Fn(&mut Ui, Rect))`, `.patch`, `.patch_part`, `.slot`,
/// There is **no** `.editable(bool)` (§23 K2, G4).
///
/// ## Variants
/// `Family::GRID`, `DEFAULT` only.
///
/// ## States
/// The grid wears `FOCUSED`, `FOCUS_VISIBLE` and `HOVERED` from the
/// runtime and `READ_ONLY` when the model gives a reason. The cursor row
/// derives `FOCUSED`, the cursor cell `ACTIVE`, a selected row `SELECTED`, a
/// checked row `CHECKED`, a cell in the range `SELECTED`, an edited cell
/// `EDITING`, and `ERROR`/`DIRTY` from [`CellDecor`]. Empty loading and error
/// states are explicit [`EmptyState`] values.
///
/// ## Actions
/// [`GridAction`]. Sort is a keyed adapter request; filter, refresh and
/// row-lifecycle behavior remains in application bindings.
///
/// ## Focus
/// One `Focusable` stop for the whole grid. While a cell is being edited the
/// inline editor holds focus and swallows typing, so the grid's own table
/// stops firing without any flag.
///
/// ## Keyboard
/// `↑`/`k`, `↓`/`j`, `←`/`h`, `→`/`l`, `PgUp`, `PgDn`, `Home`/`End` (row
/// ends), `Ctrl+Home`/`Ctrl+End` and `g`/`G` (first / last row),
/// `Shift+arrows` (extend the rectangular range), `Space` (select the row),
/// `Ctrl+A` (all), `Enter` (activate, or begin an edit under
/// `update_editable`), `F2` (begin an edit), `Ctrl+C` (copy as TSV).
///
/// ## Mouse
/// `PartRef::item(Part::CELL, row)`: press moves the cursor to the cell under
/// the pointer, double-click activates or begins an edit.
/// `PartRef::item(Part::ACTIONS, row)`: the cell affordance's hot zone, which
/// is registered after the cell and therefore wins the click.
/// `PartRef::of(Part::ROW)` is the fetch-more row. `TRACK`/`THUMB` and the
/// wheel go to the embedded [`ScrollRegion`].
///
/// ## Layout
/// A header row, an optional read-only reason row, the body, and an optional
/// action row. Column widths are **sampled** from the visible rows and the
/// titles, clamped into each column's `min_width..=max_width`; sticky columns
/// are pinned to the left and the rest scroll in a window with `‹N` / `N›`
/// overflow indicators. `measure` is `(the sampled total, rows + chrome)`;
/// `draw` returns `area`. `0×0` registers nothing (R5).
///
/// ## Parts
/// `CONTAINER` (the whole surface, filled on **every** non-degenerate frame,
/// which is why it is `PARTS[0]`), `HEADER`, `ROW`, `CELL`, `TRACK`, `THUMB`,
/// `OVERFLOW`, `EMPTY`, `ACTIONS`, plus the optional detailed-gutter surfaces
/// `GUTTER`, `MARKER`, `CHANGE` and `ROW_NUMBER` (§17.0 A7). Compact paints its
/// focus and shared selection/change markers from `ROW`; Detailed resolves
/// the four distinct parts in their clipped subcells. The fetch sentinel
/// resolves only `GUTTER`, never a synthetic data-row number. A configured
/// keyed header prefix additionally resolves `ICON`; this is not a whole-grid
/// status surface.
///
/// Fetch wording and activity are borrowed props. An activity frame composes
/// canonical Spinner: its PROGRESS ICON/LABEL overrides belong to the child,
/// while Grid ROW overrides retain the row fill and idle glyph. No loaded-row
/// readiness is derived from this presentation option.
///
/// ## Overrides
/// `.patch` and `.patch_part` reach `Part::CONTAINER`, `Part::HEADER`,
/// `Part::ROW`, `Part::CELL`, `Part::TRACK`, `Part::THUMB`, `Part::OVERFLOW`,
/// `Part::EMPTY` and `Part::ACTIONS`, plus all four detailed-gutter parts when
/// enabled, and `ICON` for configured header prefixes. `.slot` replaces `Part::HEADER`, `Part::EMPTY`, `Part::ACTIONS`,
/// `Part::TRACK`, `Part::THUMB`, each enabled detailed-gutter subcell, and
/// each header-prefix `ICON`. `HEADER` replacement suppresses all header content.
/// `ACTIONS` reaches both configured action surfaces and cell affordances.
/// `TRACK` and `THUMB` are forwarded into the embedded [`ScrollRegion`], as
/// are `.patch` and `.patch_part`.
///
/// ## Identity
/// Rows are [`ItemKey`]s from `GridModel::row_key`, columns are
/// [`ColumnKey`]s from the column list. The cursor, the range anchor, the
/// selection and the edited cell are **all** stored keyed and re-resolved to
/// indices every phase, so a model that reorders itself between frames moves
/// none of them.
///
/// ## Testing
/// `GridCase` with `ACTIVATES | FOCUSABLE | COLLECTION | SCROLLS | EDITS`,
/// registered once and run through both entry points from `Fixture.read_only`
/// (§23 K2); `crates/tui/tests/fixtures/grid_model.rs` is a display-only model
/// that implements `GridModel` **alone**, so it is a compile-time witness that
/// the read-only entry point needs nothing from `GridEditor`.
///
/// ## Invariants
/// `reconcile` runs before any action is emitted (G7); draw invokes the model
/// only for visible cells (explicit load sampling is separate); a frame
/// allocates nothing per row or per cell; `draw`
/// takes `&GridState` and `&M`, so it can neither commit nor cancel an edit
/// (G2).
